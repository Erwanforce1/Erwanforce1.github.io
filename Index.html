     <h3><p ALIGN=CENTER>A tagine is both the name of a cooking vessel, and of the the stew that is made in it. The tagine is a conical shaped dish very popular in Morocco. They are mostly used to slow cook and braise stews with vegetables and meats until meat is melt in your mouth tender.</p></h3>
	 <h3><p ALIGN=CENTER>The conical lid allows steam to circulate during cooking, which creates condensation that drips back onto the meat, fish or veggies, keeping food moist. They come in earthenware, ceramic and metal varieties.</p></h3>
	 <h3><p ALIGN=CENTER>Tagines can be used on the stovetop or in the oven, and for years been used just over charcoal, slow cooking meats into tender submission. Many times they are used as tableware to serve, adding authentic exotic flair.</p></h3>

	 <h3><ol>
	 <li>Coat beef chunks with all spice rub ingredients.
     <li>Heat olive oil in a pot over medium high heat and sear the meat for about 10 minutes, till it browns up all side. For this, leave it undisturbed for 5 minutes before flipping.
     <li>Add in chopped onions and cook till tender, about 6-7 minutes. Next, add chopped ginger and garlic and cook for a couple of minutes. Stir in tomato paste and cook for a few more minutes.
     <li>Add in diced canned tomatoes, beef broth and remaining spices (paprika, Spanish paprika, cinnamon, turmeric, cumin, coriander). Combine well. Let it come to a boil, then reduce the temperature to medium low. Cover and cook for 45 minutes.
     <li>Add in carrots and garbanzo beans continue cooking, covered, for 30 minutes.
     <li>Stir in apricots and raisins and cook with the lid on. Every now and then, stir the pot. If you feel the sauce is getting too thick, add in extra water (I added an extra 1 cup). Cook till meat is tender and melts in your mouth, about another 2 hours, depending on the size of the chunks.
     <li>Add in potatoes in the last 25 to 30 minutes. Taste and adjust for salt and pepper.
